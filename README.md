# Hatch code challenge

CLI program that reads two json files and compares them for equality, printing out the result on stdout.

## Build

In order to build the project you must have the [go sdk installed](https://go.dev/doc/install) on your system. The project was developed with the latest v1.18.

## Run

The program has two arguments for the filepaths of both json files to compare.

```bash
‚ùØ executable filepath1 filepath2
```

There's a makefile to make compilation easier and several json file samples in **./resources** folder for testing.

You have three options:

Local build of the executable

```bash
projects/go-stuff/hatch-code-challenge on ÓÇ† main [!] via üêπ v1.18
‚ùØ make build
go build -o hatch ./cmd/hatch

projects/go-stuff/hatch-code-challenge on ÓÇ† main [!?] via üêπ v1.18
‚ùØ ./hatch resources/equal/unordered_small_file_before_backup.json resources/equal/unordered_small_file_after_backup.json
```

System wide installation

```bash
projects/go-stuff/hatch-code-challenge on ÓÇ† main [!] via üêπ v1.18
‚ùØ make install
go install ./cmd/hatch

projects/go-stuff/hatch-code-challenge on ÓÇ† main [!?] via üêπ v1.18
‚ùØ hatch resources/equal/unordered_small_file_before_backup.json resources/equal/unordered_small_file_after_backup.json
```

Run directly with temp generated executable

```bash
projects/go-stuff/hatch-code-challenge on ÓÇ† main [!?] via üêπ v1.18
‚ùØ go run ./cmd/hatch/main.go resources/equal/unordered_small_file_before_backup.json resources/equal/unordered_small_file_after_backup.json
```

## Testing

Along with the source code, there are unit test for all the main components. To run them use the makefile recipe

```bash
‚ùØ make test
go test -v ./...
